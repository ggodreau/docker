Running docker images:
docker run --rm busybox sleep 1 # automatically removes container from docker ps -a after the container exits
docker run --name myContainerName busybox # names your container instead of giving it an autogenerated name
docker inspect myContainerName # outputs container info to terminal in json format

Removing images:
docker -rmi busybox # removes image 'busybox'

Running Tomcat:

Viewing container logs:
docker logs <container long ID> # outputs the system logs to STDOUT

Layers:

Committing container changes to a new image:
docker ps -a # get the namme or ID of the image you just ran
docker commit <ID of container you just ran> jameslee/debian:1.00 # commits your image diff to your docker hub account, returns the long ID of the image to you
